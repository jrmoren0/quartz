# Agile Development
##### Project Management
Product Management is the art and science of building the right product for the right people. It encompasses understanding what to build, why to build it, and how to position it. Part marketer, part engineer, part sales, and part project manager, the product manager needs to understand the business, marketplace and customer to make sure they come together to form an amazing product.

- ###### Agile Development
	-  The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) 
	- Only work on the most important things at any given point in time
	- Break those things into small bite-sized tasks for individuals to work on autonomously    
	
	- Catch up for about 10-20 minutes every morning on progress
	-   Meet at the end of a set of 'things' to plan the next set of 'things

# Scrum Framework!

#####  Basics of Scrum
###### Steps

![](Scrum-workflow.png)
1.  In the [sprint planning](https://clickup.com/blog/agile/sprint-planning/) phase, teams agree on what product backlog items they want to work on. The product backlog is a list of tasks, bug fixes, user feedback that a team needs to work on to complete the project.
   
2. The team adds the product backlog items on a [Scrum board](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/).(Same as KanBan board!)
   
3. Step 3: Teams host [Scrum meetings](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-meetings/) known as daily Scrum standups, to discuss their progress and the issues they’ve faced.
   
4. Once the sprint ends, the team showcases the product to the users at the sprint review meeting.
   
5. The Scrum team then hosts a sprint retrospective, where they discuss ways to improve their next Scrum sprint performance.
   
6. The Scrum team then starts on the next sprint until the entire development process is complete!
